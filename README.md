## About

This repository is a detailed record of my learning journey in programming. It tracks my daily progress in various topics, including:
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Python, SQL
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Searching, and more.
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development basics, SEO, and front-end technologies.

### Why I Created This Repository:
- **Structured Learning**: To break down complex concepts into manageable learning chunks.
- **Track Progress**: To have a log of my learning milestones and reflect on how much Iâ€™ve grown over time.
- **Share with the Community**: To help others who are on a similar learning journey and to collaborate with others to improve further.

Each dayâ€™s entry documents:
- **What I learned**: New concepts and topics covered.
- **Challenges Solved**: Coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
- **Projects Built**: Hands-on projects that apply the learned concepts.

## Technologies & Tools
- **C++**: Used for mastering DSA and problem-solving.
- **Python**: Applied for algorithmic solutions and scripting.
- **SQL**: For data querying and database management.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For web development and building interactive websites.
- **LeetCode, HackerRank**: For practicing coding challenges and improving problem-solving skills.
- **Git, GitHub**: To manage version control and track progress.
